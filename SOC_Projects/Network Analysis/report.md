 <strong>Confidentiality Notice:</strong>

This project simulates an internal SOC investigation scenario. All IP addresses, traffic, and findings are based on controlled lab data and are used strictly for educational and portfolio purposes.


 <strong>Executive Summary:</strong>

This project documents the investigation of a multi-stage internal network compromise identified through detailed packet capture (PCAP) analysis. The analysis revealed a critical security posture failure, driven by the continued use of an insecure legacy protocol and the absence of layered defensive controls.

<strong>Key Findings:</strong>

The investigation confirmed three concurrent attack vectors:<br>
	1.	Credential Compromise via FTP Brute-Force Attacks<br>
	•	Repeated login attempts against an insecure FTP service resulted in clear-text credential exposure.<br>
	2.	Internal Lateral Movement<br>
	•	Stealth port scanning and suspicious communication patterns between internal hosts indicated an attacker foothold and internal reconnaissance.<br>
	3.	Multiple Internal Attack Sources<br>
	•	Malicious activity originated from several internal IP addresses, suggesting either multiple compromised hosts or coordinated insider-level behavior.<br>

<strong> Critical Risk Identified:</strong>
The use of FTP, a clear-text protocol, enabled credential theft and allowed attackers to pivot internally.

<strong>High-Level Recommendation:</strong><br>

Immediate decommissioning of FTP, migration to secure file transfer protocols (SFTP/FTPS), and enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are required to prevent recurrence.

 **Interpretation & Impact:**
	•	Clear-Text Credential Exposure: FTP allowed attackers to directly read usernames and passwords from network traffic.<br>
	•	Confirmed Lateral Movement: Compromised hosts actively scanned and communicated with internal systems.<br>
	•	Threat Severity: The combination of credential theft, internal pivoting, and multiple attack sources elevates this incident to Critical severity.<br>


 

**Incident Response Evaluation**

**Application of the CyBOK Incident Response Model**

The CyBOK Incident Response Model provides a structured, end-to-end framework for managing security incidents, ensuring that detection, response, and recovery activities are handled systematically rather than reactively. Applying this model to the identified network compromise highlights both the strengths of structured incident handling and the gaps that allowed the attack to succeed.

**Preparation**

The Preparation phase focuses on ensuring that security controls, tools, policies, and monitoring capabilities are in place before an incident occurs. In the context of this investigation, this phase represents the most significant failure. The continued use of the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), a legacy protocol that transmits credentials in clear text, indicates a lack of protocol governance and secure configuration standards. Proper preparation would have included decommissioning insecure services, enforcing encrypted alternatives such as SFTP or FTPS, and implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA). Had these controls been in place, the primary attack vector—credential compromise via brute force—would have been effectively neutralized.

**Detection and Analysis**

The Detection and Analysis phase involves identifying suspicious activity, validating that an incident has occurred, and determining its scope and impact. In this project, packet capture (PCAP) analysis using Wireshark served as the primary detection mechanism. Repeated FTP login attempts, clear-text credential transmission, SYN-based scanning behavior, and patterned low-volume traffic were identified as indicators of compromise. Analysis of these indicators confirmed not only external-style brute-force behavior but also internal lateral movement between hosts. This phase demonstrates how network traffic analysis can reveal both initial access techniques and post-compromise attacker behavior. However, it also highlights a detection gap, as such high-volume and repetitive activity should ideally trigger real-time alerts from an IDS or SIEM rather than being discovered post-event through manual analysis.

**Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**

Once the incident was confirmed, the CyBOK model emphasizes rapid containment to prevent further damage. In this scenario, containment would require immediate isolation of all identified compromised hosts to stop ongoing brute-force attempts, scanning, and control communications. Eradication would involve removing any malicious artifacts, terminating unauthorized access, and revoking all potentially exposed credentials. Because credentials were transmitted in clear text, password resets alone would be insufficient without also eliminating the insecure protocol that enabled the compromise. Recovery focuses on restoring services securely, which in this case includes deploying encrypted file transfer services, applying necessary system patches, and validating that rebuilt hosts are free of persistence mechanisms before reconnecting them to the network.

**Post-Incident Activity**

The Post-Incident Activity phase ensures that lessons learned from the incident are translated into long-term security improvements. For this investigation, this phase is critical, as the root cause was not a zero-day vulnerability but an avoidable configuration and policy failure. A formal post-incident review would document the risks associated with legacy protocol usage, the lack of internal network segmentation, and insufficient detection of brute-force behavior. Recommendations such as mandatory MFA, improved internal firewalling, intrusion prevention systems, and stronger monitoring rules should be incorporated into organizational policy and training. This phase shifts the organization from a reactive posture to a proactive security stance, reducing the likelihood and impact of similar incidents in the future.

**Overall Value of the CyBOK Model**

Applying the CyBOK Incident Response Model to this scenario demonstrates its strength as a comprehensive and knowledge-driven framework. It not only guides technical response actions but also emphasizes governance, policy enforcement, and organizational learning. In complex, multi-stage incidents like this one, the model ensures that response efforts address both immediate threats and the systemic weaknesses that enabled the compromise.


**Recommendations:**

 i. Decommission FTP Services: Replace all FTP services with secure alternatives like SFTP/FTPS.<br>
 ii. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA to prevent credential compromise.<br>
 iii. Monitor Internal Traffic: Use IDS/IPS solutions to detect and block lateral movement and C2 communication.<br>
 iv. Conduct Regular Security Audits: Periodically review and update security configurations.<br>


**Lessons Learned:**
	•	Legacy protocols are silent killers in modern networks<br>
	•	Detection without prevention leads to delayed response<br>
	•	Flat networks amplify damage after compromise<br>


**Conclusion:**

This investigation confirms a critical internal network compromise driven by insecure protocol usage and insufficient internal controls. By eliminating FTP, enforcing MFA, improving segmentation, and strengthening detection, the organization can significantly improve its security posture.
