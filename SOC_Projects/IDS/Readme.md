**Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Projects**

**Overview**

This folder contains hands-on Intrusion Detection System (IDS) projects focused on configuring, testing, and analyzing network traffic using Snort and Suricata.
The goal of these projects was to understand how IDS tools detect suspicious activity, generate alerts, and support threat detection in real-world environments.

**Tools Used**

- Snort – Signature-based IDS/IPS

- Suricata – High-performance, multi-threaded IDS/IPS

- Nmap – Network scanning and reconnaissance

- hping3 – Packet crafting and traffic generation

- SSH – Secure remote access traffic

- ICMP – Network diagnostic traffic (ping)

**Project Scope**

In these projects, I configured and tested IDS rules to monitor and detect the following traffic patterns:

ICMP Traffic

Detection of ping requests and potential reconnaissance activity

Nmap Scans

Identification of common scan techniques used for network enumeration

hping3 Traffic

Detection of crafted packets and abnormal traffic patterns

SSH Traffic

Monitoring SSH connections and identifying suspicious access attempts

**Key Activities**

Installation and configuration of Snort and Suricata

Writing and tuning custom detection rules

Generating test traffic using Nmap and hping3

Analyzing alerts and logs produced by the IDS

Understanding false positives and rule optimization

**Learning Outcomes**

Practical understanding of IDS architecture and rule-based detection

Improved ability to recognize reconnaissance and attack patterns

Hands-on experience with alert analysis and traffic inspection

Exposure to real-world SOC detection workflows

Status

-  Completed core IDS configurations and testing
- Future improvements may include log correlation, alert visualization, and integration with SIEM tools
