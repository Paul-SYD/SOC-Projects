## Overview
This project documents a hands-on vulnerability assessment conducted using Nessus on Metaploitable 2.  
The goal of this assessment was to identify, analyze, and understand security weaknesses within a target system and provide actionable remediation recommendations.

This project demonstrates my ability to perform vulnerability scanning, interpret results, assess risk severity, and document findings in a structured and professional manner.

- Perform a vulnerability scan on a target system using Nessus  
- Identify security misconfigurations, outdated services, and known vulnerabilities  
- Analyze vulnerability severity using CVSS scores  
- Recommend remediation steps to reduce security risk  
- Document findings in a clear and technical report format
