**My SOC Analyst Journey Portfolio
**
Welcome to my Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst Portfolio.
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey into cybersecurity, with a strong focus on threat detection, network analysis, vulnerability assessment, and intrusion detection systems.

I am building practical SOC skills by working on real-world–style labs and documenting each project to reflect how security analysts investigate, detect, and respond to threats.


**Objective**

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate:<br>
 •	Practical SOC analyst skills<br>
 •	Understanding of security fundamentals and workflows<br>
 •	Ability to analyze alerts, traffic, and logs<br>
 •	Clear documentation and analytical thinking<br>

This repository will grow as I continue learning and building more advanced projects
